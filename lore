//	NOTD: Aftermath offers little insight on the outbreak of the zombie infection and limits itself to explain that it first hit Boston,
//	which is then reinforced by the introduction of Golf Company during the Lost Cause Chapter as their marines were the ones deployed to the city
//	and, most certainly, of the few who made it alive.
//
//	In NOTD: Outbreak I intend to dive deeper and situate the Boston Outbreak as a direct result of the actual origins of the infection,
//	one that comes from a much more rural background from relatively isolated government facilities, much similar to how Residence 41 in
//	NOTD: Aftermath proves to be a complex and important building in a rural environment.

//
//	One year before the Boston outbreak, a few miles north of Concord, Massachusetts, a local law enforcement case triggers alarms in the US Government.
//	A total of 5 children, 3 girls and 2 boys, have been reported missing and the local families are hysterical about the situation.
//	Furthermore, strange and counter productive orders have been issued by the local authorities which have only deepened the complicated scenario in
//	which the Carlisle inhabitants find themselves.
//
//	After local press have pressured the authorities and farmers have began lobbying the respective congressmen and congresswomen to cover up the situation
//	in fears it could endanger the market, the US Marine Corps has been deployed to assist local law enforcement to control the situation and assess the
//	seriousness of it.
//
//	What the marines would never know is that they're being played as a reactionary force to a much greater problem than they could imagine...
